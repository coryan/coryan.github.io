Skye is a small C++11 mocking library in the action -> assertion style.
Its main advantage over other mocking frameworks is the support for
template member functions and template classes in general.
It is also less tedious than libraries that require you to specify all
the expectations in advance, even if you only care about a small
subset.

The main disadvantage is that I only implement the pieces that I need
for my code, and you may need more.
