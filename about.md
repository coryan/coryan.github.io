Thanks for reading!

This is my blog, it does not have a name, well, it does, because the
software made me.
I was told I should have one of these, I was also
told it stands for "I ramble on about things that nobody cares about",
or maybe "web log", or maybe it is now a word that does not stand for
anything.

Mostly I wanted a place to express my opinions and thoughts about
software engineering and such.

Who am I?
---------

A husband, a father, a former rock climber, a former cross-fitter.
This blog will likely deal mostly with my software development
interests, so for those purposes:  a software engineering manager by
trade.  A sofware engineer by training and inclination.  I currently
work for one of those large web companies, leading a few DevOps-like
teams.  I used to work in high-frequency trading leading a few
software engineering and Ops teams.
I have a PhD in computer engineering, in
the area of distributed real-time systems (yes, they do exist), a
masters in computer science, and a bachellors in math (so at some
point I could do algebra all by myself!).

I have been coding since 1985, and programming professionally (as in
my main source of income) since the early 90's and arguably since
1989.
My main programming language is C++ since I think 1990, but I have
done C, Fortran, Assembly, Perl, Python, Ruby, Shell, R, K, SQL and
many other
languages (yep, Java was not on that list, obviously I have read and
written a little Java, too small to count).  My main platform is Linux
these days, and I have used Solaris, VxWorks, LynxOS, HP-UX, Irix,
Domain/OS, Windows NT, Windows CE, DOS, and probably others that I
forget (is CP/M a platform?  Did I code anything on it?).

I have coded on almost anything from 8-bit microprocessors to massive
clusters, though not done much parallel programming until a year ago
when I picked up OpenCL.

I have been known to craft a webpage or two, but they do not look
nice.  If this one does, is because I took the templates from
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) and did not mess with them.
Their [License](/Lanyon-LICENSE.md) is reproduced on this site.  I
have been known to craft a GUI or two, but the 
last time was on X11/Motif, and (you can laugh) most of the graphics
were plain Xlib, with some OpenGL added later.  That is to say, I
have been mostly building and/or leading teams that build "infrastructure
software" of some kind or another.  Low level stuff that when it
breaks, the whole company stops.  Things where the only user interface
is some kind of RPC, or at best some kind of status page.

PS: You got all the way here?  Color me impressed.
