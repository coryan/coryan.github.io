Thanks for reading!

This is my blog, it should not have a name,
it only does because the software made me.
As far as I can tell this is a perfect forum for me to talk at length
about things that nobody cares about.

Mostly I wanted a place to express my opinions and thoughts about
software engineering and such.  Sometimes I will even believe the
opinions that I express about software engineering and such.
I also wanted to be able to describe some of the software projects I
write as a hobby.

Who am I?
---------

A husband, a father, a former rock climber, a former cross-fitter.
This blog will likely deal mostly with my software development
interests, so for those purposes:  a software engineering manager by
trade.  A sofware engineer by training and inclination.  I currently
work for Google, leading a few SRE teams, what the rest of the world
seems to call DevOps, but at Google everything has a different name.
Before that I worked for a decade in high-frequency trading leading a
few software engineering and Ops teams.
Before that I was a PhD student, in
the area of distributed real-time systems (yes, they do exist).
Before working on my PhD I spent a few years working on military
training systems for general staff officers.  Picture a small-scale
MMORPG with convincing simulation of troop movements, logistics and
engagements.
My undergrad degree is in math, so at some
point I could do algebra all by myself.

I have been coding since 1985, and programming professionally (as in
my main source of income) since I think 1989, but could be 1988,
cannot remember anymore.
My main programming language is C++, since I think 1990, but I have
done C, Fortran, Assembly, Perl, Python, Ruby, Shell, R, K, SQL and
many other
languages (yep, Java was not on that list, obviously I have read and
written a little Java, too small to count).  My main platform is Linux
these days, and I have used Solaris, VxWorks, LynxOS, HP-UX, Irix,
Domain/OS, Windows NT, Windows CE, DOS, and probably others that I
forget (is CP/M a platform?  Did I code anything on it?).

I have coded on almost anything from 8-bit microprocessors to multiple
core computers (and using all the cores, mind you), to massive
clusters.
I only recently picked parallel programming when I was teaching myself
OpenCL.

I have been known to craft a webpage or two, but they do not look
nice.  If this one does, is because I took the templates from
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) and did not mess with them (too much).
Their [License](/Lanyon-LICENSE.md) is reproduced on this site.  I
have been known to craft a GUI or two, but the 
last time was on X11/Motif, and (you can laugh) most of the graphics
were plain Xlib, with some OpenGL added later.  That is to say, I
have been mostly building and/or leading teams that build "infrastructure
software" of some kind or another.  Low level stuff that when it
breaks, the whole company stops.  Things where the only user interface
is some kind of RPC, or at best some kind of status page.

PS: You got all the way here?  Color me impressed.
